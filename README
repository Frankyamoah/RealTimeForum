Running the Project
Prerequisites:
Go: Ensure you have Go installed.
Python: Ensure you have Python installed to use the simple HTTP server for the frontend.
Steps to Run:
Clone the repository:

Copy code
git clone <https://learn.01founders.co/git/fyamoah/real-time-forum.git>
cd real-time-forum
Install Frontend Dependencies:

Navigate to the frontend folder and install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Run the Backend (Go Server):

Open a terminal and navigate to the backend folder:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
Run the Go server:
bash
Copy code
go run main.go
The backend will start running, typically on http://localhost:8080 (or another port, depending on your configuration).

Run the Frontend (Python HTTP Server):

In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend folder where your HTML and JavaScript files are located:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Run the Python HTTP server to serve the frontend files:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m http.server 8000
This will start the frontend server on http://localhost:8000.

Access the Application:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to access the frontend.
The backend (API and WebSocket) will be running on http://localhost:8080 or whichever port you have configured in the Go server.
Summary:
Backend: Runs with go run main.go in the backend folder.
Frontend: Runs with python3 -m http.server 8000 in the frontend folder.
